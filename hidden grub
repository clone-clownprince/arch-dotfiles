Hide GRUB unless the Shift key is held down
In order to achieve the fastest possible boot, instead of having GRUB wait for a timeout, it is possible for GRUB to hide the menu, unless the Shift key is held down during GRUB's start-up.

In order to achieve this, you should add the following line to /etc/default/grub:

GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU="true"
Then create the file /etc/grub.d/31_hold_shift containing [1], make it exectuable, and regenerate the grub configuration:

# chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/31_hold_shift
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
